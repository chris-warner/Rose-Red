# Rose-Red
This project is inspired by Rose Red by Steven King. The goal of this project is to make a Javascript "House" modeled after the infamous " Winchester Mystery House". The house continues to build itself on its own after even though no one has lived there for decades. By using AI generated "ghost", the house and code will continue to build in new and unpredictable ways, and you must escape before the house consumes you. 

Just like the real house, the story starts with an unfinished farmhouse. The intro shows the development of the house as workers worked night and day to turn it into a seven story mansion.
